## A Minimalist Take on AVA
Because [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) is awesome. Security alerts on dev
dependencies are not awesome. Especially when you use the same test library
across dozens of projects. No matter how well maintained a project is, when it
contains [300+ dependencies](http://npm.broofa.com/?q=ava) security alerts are
going to occur.

[But It's Just a Dev Dependency...](https://medium.com/swlh/but-its-just-a-dev-dependency-566646ebeec9)

## What's good about it
- It has 0 dependencies (and devDependencies)
- It's more emojified than AVA (of course that matters zero)
- It can be called via the `mvt` cli or by simply calling `node [test-file].js`
- It doesn't transpile your code (the code you write is the code we test)
- It also has no dependencies (oh, maybe I already mentioned that)

## What it lacks (the most notable items)
- Concurrency
  - That's not a thing here (likely never will be)
- Transpilation
  - Also not a thing here (definitely never will be)
  - Actually, maybe I should add this to "What's good..."
  - I added it...
- TAP Reporter
  - I honestly don't even know what that is
  - I'll look it up and implement it at some point
  - It's right there on AVA's list of cool isht, so it must be cool
- A community and product maturity
  - Among the most crucial elements
  - And the primary reason you may want to stick to AVA

## This might be for you if
- You're willing to sacrifice all of the above (and more) to reduce dependencies

```

## Usage

```sh
mvt
# OR
mvt test
# OR
mvt test.js test2.js
# OR
mvt --verbose
# OR
mvt test --verbose
# OR
node test.js --verbose
# etc...
```

```js
const test = require('mvt')

test.setup({ verbose: true })

test.after(() => console.log('test.after invoked'))

test.before(() => console.log('test.before invoked'))

test('assert.is works', (assert) => {
  assert.is(1, 1)
})

test.failing('test.failing and assert.fail works', (assert) => {
  assert.fail()
})

test.todo('test.todo works')

test.only('test.only works', (assert) => assert.truthy('only'))

test.bench('test.bench works', (assert) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(), 200)
  })
}, { samples: 5, max: 300 })

## API

### Test Function
The only thing this module exports.

#### `test` ( `String` message, `[Async]Function` testFunction )
Main function, give it a message and a test function. Test function
receives the `assert` object (see below).

### Setup and Teardown

#### `test.setup` ( `Object` opts )
Use this to configure your tests. Currently there is only one option.

###### opts
  - `verbose` (`Boolean`) - Print every test if `true`

#### `test.before` ( `[Async]Function` )
Run this before we start running any tests.

#### `test.after` ( `[Async]Function` )
Run this after we run all tests.

### Test Modifiers

#### `test.only` ( `String` message, `[Async]Function` testFunction )
Tests will only be run on any tests run with this modifier.

#### `test.skip` ( `String` message, `[Async]Function` testFunction )
Skip that test (logical enough).

#### `test.failing` ( `String` message, `[Async]Function` testFunction )
This test must fail. If it passes, we'll fail your whole test suite. Goteem.

### Special Tests

#### `test.bench` ( `String` message, `[Async]Function` testFunction, `Object` opts )
Run the `testFunction` `opts.samples || 10` times. If average run duration is
more than `opts.max || 100` milliseconds fail the test.

###### opts
  - `samples` (`Number`) - How many times we should run the `testFunction`
  - `max` (`Number` in ms) - Maximum average duration threshhold

### Assertions
Methods available on `assert` object passed to testFunction

##### `is` (a, b) - `a` and `b` must be identical

##### `not` (a, b) - `a` and `b` must not be identical

##### `pass` () - Passes errydamntime

##### `fail` () - Fails errydamntime

##### `true` (a) - `a` must be strictly `true`

##### `false` (a) - `a` must be strictly `false`

##### `truthy` (a) - `a` must be truthy

##### `falsy` (a) - `a` must be falsy

##### `contains` (a, `String` b) - `JSON.stringify(a)` must contain `b`

##### `deepEqual` (a, b) - `a` must be `deepEqual` to `b`

##### `notDeepEqual` (a, b) - `a` must not be `deepEqual` to `b`

##### `throws` (a) - `a` must be a function, and it must throw

##### `notThrows` (a) - `a` must be a function, and it must not throw

##### `throwsAsync` (a) - `a` must be an async function, and it must throw

##### `notThrowsAsync` (a) - `a` must be an async function, and it must not throw


## Notes

- If your test file is called with the `--verbose` flag it will list all passed tests

- It fails fast and hard with `process.exit(1)`

- If you have [`diff`](https://github.com/kpdecker/jsdiff) installed as a peer
dependency, we'll use that for string diffs. To make them more readable and
what not.
